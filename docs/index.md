Hi, You've landed on my code dumping place.
It exists because of these recurring thoughts:

    "Oh! this thing again, and I forgot how I resolved it."
    "I'll probably need this thing later."

Whether itâ€™s data science, environment fixes, or system tweaks, whenever I figure something out that might save me *alot-of-google-searching* in the future, I drop it here. 

ðŸ’» Whatâ€™s inside?

* Data Science Stuff (mostly .py)
* Automation, utility scripts, environment setups (.sh, .py)
* Git configurations & aliases (.sh, .gitconfig)
* LaTeX templates for reports & papers (.tex)
* Code snippets for quick reference (.md, .py)
* and some other random stuff.

If you find something useful, feel free to grab it.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
