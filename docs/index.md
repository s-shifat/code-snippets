# Code Snippets Repository

This repository is where I keep useful code snippets, handy scripts, and quick solutions I use often or might need in the future. Instead of searching through old projects or rewriting the same code, I can just grab what I need from here.

It's a mix of utility functions, small automation scripts, and coding tricks that save time and effort. If anything here helps you, feel free to use it too!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
